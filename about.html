  <h1>About LEI YU</h1>
  <h2>I never stopped making effort to meet my goals and never afraid of pushing my boundaries. This mindset sent me to study abroad in a top business school in the U.S.A., established a fashion
    label and chain restaurants business in China, and now with my interest in high tech products and business background, I am pursuing my career as an UX designer in Germany.
